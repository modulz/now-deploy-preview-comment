# now-deploy-preview-comment

> Github action to comment with the now.sh deployment preview URL
>
> Inspired by netlify.com deployment preview comments

## Result

![preview](./preview.png)

## Requirements

* `ZEIT_TOKEN` => The token used for deployment and query the zeit.co API
* `ZEIT_TEAMID` => This is required if your deployment is made on team project.
* `PROJECT_ID` => This is required to ensure deployments are only referenced for a specific project.
* `meta-commit` => Add the SHA commit to the meta of the deployment (`-m commit=${GITHUB_SHA}`)
* `meta-branch` => Add the ref/branch to the meta of the deployment (`-m commit=${GITHUB_REF}`)

## Example

* This is a complete `.github/workflow/deploy-preview.yml` example.
* Be sure to include `-m commit=${GITHUB_SHA} -m branch=${GITHUB_REF}` in the now deploy command or the pull request comment will fail.
